A personal website built with Bootstrap-React and Create React App.

Though some pages are a bit silly, they showcase my abilites to use various bootstrap components.  And, yes, it's a clunky site but was a good learning experience.

Built while taking Responsive Web Applications with Bootstrap and CSS course at Metropolia.

Live site: https://stafford-portfolio.herokuapp.com/

Note: the live site will be painfully slow (as in 10 seconds!!!) to initially load, but that's what you get for free hosting on Heroku (the server goes into hibernation every 30 minutes).
